Hello! I'm a programmer and educaator, looking to upload some of the stuff I've made over the years to github soon. A lot of stuff is code I wrote for working with students, so I have to pull out PII before I share it with the world. 

My current interests are reverse engineering and infosec, but I've had a long interest in functional programming, and you'll see all sorts of stuff here soon enough.

If you want looking for my coding or math lessons, including interview prep such as data structures and algorithms, best place to reach me is https://riverlikesmath.com/about#contact.
