Hello! I'm a programmer and educator, looking to upload some of the stuff I've made over the years to github soon. I've written a decent amount of code for my lessons and personal projects that I'd love to clean up and share.  

I've got a lot of interests, and I've got a personal project planned that should help me practice all sorts of things like the back-end (Node, Express, Django, etc.), machine learning, and reverse engineering. My hope is to upload that project here soon. You might also see some stuff in C, assembly, Rust, or Haskell.
