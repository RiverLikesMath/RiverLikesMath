Hello! I'm a programmer and educator, looking to upload some of the stuff I've made over the years to github soon. I've written a decent abmount of code for my lessons that I'd love to clean up and share.  

My current interests are reverse engineering and infosec, but I've had a long interest in functional programming, and you'll see all sorts of stuff here soon enough.

If you're looking for my coding or math lessons, including interview prep such as data structures and algorithms, best place to reach me is https://riverlikesmath.com/about#contact.
